/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Event Management App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to all events, but restricts write access.
 * Since there's no authentication implemented, all write operations are disabled.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All events are stored in the top-level `/events/{eventId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted for `get` and `list` operations on the `/events` collection.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) are explicitly denied because there is no authentication.
