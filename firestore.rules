/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Agenda Alego app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model where any authenticated user can read event data,
 * but only users with an 'admin' role (indicated by the presence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`)
 * can create, update, or delete events.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event details (date, name, location, transmission type, background color).  All authenticated users can read events. Only admins can write.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}:  Presence of a document indicates that the user {userId} has admin privileges. Document content is ignored.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access to Events:  Events are publicly readable by all authenticated users.
 * - Admin-Only Writes: Only users with an admin role can create, update, or delete events.
 * - No User Listing: Listing of users is not permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `roles_admin` collection exemplifies denormalization.  Instead of storing roles as a field *within* a user document, the *existence* of a document at `/roles_admin/{userId}` directly grants admin privileges.  This allows a simple `exists()` check in the rules, avoiding the need to read and parse user documents for role information.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Admin roles are stored in a separate top-level collection (`roles_admin`) instead of being embedded within event documents or user documents.  This simplifies the rules and improves security by clearly separating data and authorization concerns.
