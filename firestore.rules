/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Agenda Alego app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model where only administrators can create, update, or delete events.
 * Any authenticated user can read event details. Anonymous users can also read event details.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Presence of a document indicates admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Only administrators can modify events.
 * - All authenticated users can view events.
 * - The `roles_admin` collection uses the "existence over content" principle. The *content* of documents in this collection is ignored. Only the *existence* of a document for a given `userId` grants admin privileges.
