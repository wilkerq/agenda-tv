/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Agenda Alego app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a public-read, admin-write model for events,
 * with administrative privileges managed through a dedicated 'roles_admin' collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data, publicly readable.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges; existence of document grants access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Events are publicly readable to all authenticated users.
 * - Only users with a document in the /roles_admin collection can create, update, or delete events.
 * - User listing is disabled.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The /roles_admin/{userId} collection is used for role-based authorization. The existence of a document serves as proof of admin privileges,
 *   avoiding the need to store and check role values within the document itself.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Admin roles are managed in a separate collection to avoid mixing user-specific data with event data.
