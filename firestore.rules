/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for the Agenda Alego app.
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model.
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event details, publicly readable.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges; existence grants access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Events are publicly readable but only modifiable by admins.
 * - Admin privileges are granted by the presence of a document in the `roles_admin` collection.
 * - Listing of events is public.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The presence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}` grants admin privileges, avoiding the need to store roles within user documents or query a separate collection.
