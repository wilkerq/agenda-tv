/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Agenda Alego.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a role-based access control system with public read access for events.
 * Administrative users, identified by their presence in the `roles_admin` collection, can create, update, and delete events.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/events/{eventId}`: Stores event data. All authenticated users can read events. Only admins can modify.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: Indicates administrative privileges. The existence of a document for a user grants admin access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Events are publicly readable to all authenticated users, allowing for open listing.
 * - Admin privileges are granted based on the presence of a document in the `/roles_admin` collection. This uses the "Existence over Content" principle.
 * - Non-administrators are explicitly denied write access to events.
