/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Agenda Alego app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a public-read, admin-write model for events. Any authenticated user can read event details,
 * but only users designated as admins can create, update, or delete events. Administrative privileges are granted by
 * the presence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/events/{eventId}`: Stores event data, publicly readable.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`:  A collection that grants admin privileges to a user if a document exists for their userId.
 *   The document content is ignored; only existence matters.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Events are publicly readable to promote broad access to event information.
 * - Admin-Only Write Access: Strict control over event creation, modification, and deletion is maintained by restricting
 *   these operations to designated administrators.
 * - Existence-Based Admin Roles: The presence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}` is sufficient to grant admin
 *   privileges. No additional role data is stored or checked within the document itself.
