/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Agenda Alego app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model where only authenticated administrators can create, update, or delete events.
 * All authenticated users can read event data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data, publicly readable.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Presence of document grants admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access to the 'events' collection to allow any authenticated user to view events.
 * - Administrative privileges are granted based on the existence of a document in the 'roles_admin' collection, following the "Existence over Content" principle.
 * - All write operations on the 'events' collection are restricted to administrators only.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - No denormalization is needed in this simple role based setup, as we depend on the existence of a document in another collection.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - The segregation of admin roles into a dedicated collection (`roles_admin`) simplifies access control logic.

     * @allow (create): Allows a user to create their own admin document, effectively granting themselves admin rights. Only if no document exists for that user.
     * @allow (get): Allows any authenticated user to check if a user is an admin.
     * @allow (delete): Allows the admin to remove its own document, but only if the user id matches the document being deleted.
     * @deny (create, update, delete): Non-admin users cannot create admin documents for other users.
     * @principle Uses "Existence over Content" to manage global admin roles.
