    "reasoning": "Given the application's core feature of displaying and managing events, with administrative capabilities to create events with details like name, date, location, and transmission type (YouTube or TV Aberta), the Firestore data structure should be optimized for efficient querying and administrative updates. Since there are no user-specific private events or collaborative features mentioned, a simple collection-based structure for storing events is appropriate. A single collection, `/events`, can hold all event documents. This design prioritizes simplicity and ease of querying for event display. There is no authorization implemented in this app, so we skip denormalization and membership maps. This structure supports required QAPs by storing all data in a single collection."
