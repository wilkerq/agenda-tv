    "reasoning": "Given the requirements for the Agenda Alego app, a simple and secure Firestore structure is recommended. The app focuses on displaying events and allowing administrators to create them. Since there's no user-specific data besides potential admin roles, a single collection for events is suitable. To manage administrative privileges, a dedicated collection is used, leveraging the 'Existence over Content' principle for global roles. This design prioritizes simplicity, security, and scalability.\n\n**Authorization Independence:**\n\n*   The design avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies, because the event documents do not depend on authorization parameters found in other collections.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n\n*   The design allows for secure `list` operations because all documents in the `events` collection share the same security requirements (any authenticated user can read).\n\n*   The `roles_admin` collection ensures that only authorized users can create/update/delete events."
